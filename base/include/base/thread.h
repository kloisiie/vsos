 *
 * For storing thread-specific data (called thread context) such as the stack
 * and thread-local data, there is a dedicated portion of the virtual address
 * space. This portion is called thread-context area. Within the thread-context
 * area, each thread has a fixed-sized slot, a thread context. The layout of
 * each thread context looks as follows
 *
 * ! lower address
 * !   ...
 * !   ============================ <- aligned at the virtual context size
 * !
 * !             empty
 * !
 * !   ----------------------------
 * !
 * !             stack
 * !             (top)              <- initial stack pointer
 * !   ---------------------------- <- address of 'Context' object
 * !    additional context members
 * !   ----------------------------
 * !              UTCB
 * !   ============================ <- aligned at the virtual context size
 * !   ...
 * ! higher address
 *
 * On some platforms, a user-level thread-control block (UTCB) area contains
 * data shared between the user-level thread and the kernel. It is typically
 * used for transferring IPC message payload or for system-call arguments.
 * The additional context members are a reference to the corresponding
 * 'Thread_base' object and the name of the thread.
 *
 * The thread context is a virtual memory area, initially not backed by real
 * memory. When a new thread is created, an empty thread context gets assigned
 * to the new thread and populated with memory pages for the stack and the
 * additional context members. Note that this memory is allocated from the RAM
 * session of the process environment and not accounted for when using the
 * 'sizeof()' operand on a 'Thread_base' object.
