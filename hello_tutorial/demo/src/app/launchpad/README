Launchpad is a graphical application for interactively starting and
killing programs.

By default, launchpad displays a preconfigured list of programs and their
respective default memory quotas. The user can tweak the memory quota
for each entry with mouse and then start a program by clicking on its
name. As an alternative to using the default list, you can define the list
manually by supplying a configuration to Launchpad. The following example
configuration tells launchpad to display a list of two launcher entries:

!<config>
!  <launcher>
!    <filename>sdl_pathfind</filename>
!    <ram_quota>10M</ram_quota>
!  </launcher>
!  <launcher>
!    <filename>liquid_fb</filename>
!    <ram_quota>10M</ram_quota>
!  </launcher>
!  <launcher>
!    <filename>init</filename>
!    <ram_quota>10M</ram_quota>
!    <config>
!      <start>
!        <filename>hello</filename>
!        <ram_quota>1M</ram_quota>
!      </start>
!    </config>
!  </launcher>
!</config>

To use this configuration for a Launchpad started via init, you can
simply insert the launchpad configuration into the '<start>' node
of the launchpad entry in init's 'config' file.
